# Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol M32 V2.7.1

Providing support for Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol M32. Uses the NI Host Integration protocol instead of the limited MIDI Mode NI provides, so the controller acts like as if it was connected to Ableton or Logic Pro X.

# What's new in 2.7.1

* play button flashes in sync with the tempo of project
* play, rec, loop, metro light up when engaged from FL Studio or controller
* Quantize turns off snap, Auto (aka shift + quantize) cycles through global snap options
* clear (shift + stop) closes all windows)

## Key Features

* transport works as expected (play, record, stop)
* count-in - toggles countdown before recording
* loop - toggles between pattern and loop mode
* metro - toggles metro off and on
* tempo - tap to set tempo
* undo/redo - works as expected, hold shift to redo
* quantize - toggles global snap on and off, hold shift to activate
* four-directional push encoder - up, down, left, right and push for enter/accept (works on channel rack, mixer, browser and others)

## Known Issues
* stop light will not dim - working on it an upcoming version
* eight knobs currently can only be assigned by the user -  working on volume and pan features in upcoming version
* OLED doesn't change status at all - working on it in an upcoming version




## Installation

Native Instruments Host Integration service must be installed and running. It is automatically the case
if you installed Komplete Kontrol on your machine.

1. Download **device_Native_Instruments_KOMPLETE_KONTROL_M32.py** and place int to the FL Studio User data 
folder under the following location:

... Documents\Image-Line\FL Studio\Settings\Hardware\Native Instruments

Create a **'Native Instruments' folder if one doesn't exist.**

2. In FL Studio 20.7 or higher under the MIDI tab in settings set Komplete Kontrol M DAW as Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol M32 (User).

Enjoy
