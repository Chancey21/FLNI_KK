# Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol M32 V2.7.1
Written by Duwayne 'Sound' Wright

Providing support for Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol M32. Uses the NI Host Integration protocol instead of the limited MIDI Mode NI provides, so the controller acts like as if it was connected to Ableton or Logic Pro X.

# What's new in 2.7.1

* **play** flashes in sync with the tempo of project
* **play**, **rec**, **loop**, **metro** light up when engaged from FL Studio or controller
* **qauantize** turns off snap, auto (aka **shift + quantize**) cycles through global snap options
* **clear** (**shift + stop**) closes all windows)

## Key Features

* **transport** works as expected (play, record, stop)
* **count-in** - toggles countdown before recording
* **loop** - toggles between pattern and loop mode
* **metro** - toggles metro off and on
* **tempo** - tap to set tempo
* **undo/redo** - works as expected, hold shift to redo
* **four-directional push encoder** - up, down, left, right and push for enter/accept (works on channel rack, mixer, browser and others)

## Known Issues
* **stop** light will not dim - todo
* eight knobs currently can only be assigned by the user - todo
* OLED doesn't change status at all - todo



## Installation

Native Instruments Host Integration service must be installed and running. It is automatically the case
if you installed Komplete Kontrol on your machine.

1. Download **device_Native_Instruments_KOMPLETE_KONTROL_M32.py** and place int to the FL Studio User data 
folder under the following location:

... Documents\Image-Line\FL Studio\Settings\Hardware\Native Instruments

Create a **'Native Instruments' folder if one doesn't exist.**

2. In FL Studio 20.7 or higher under the MIDI tab in settings set Komplete Kontrol M DAW as Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol M32 (User).

Enjoy
